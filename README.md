# Arch Setup Scripts

This repository is intended to house all the configs and scripts
necessary for me to reinstall Arch Linux just like I had it.
Currently it is unfinished and just contains my configs and a
unfinished list of packages. Most likely I will make it automatically
download packages and such whenever I need to reinstall Arch in the
future
